holbertonschool-web_back_end

This repository contains multiple backend-related Python projects from the Holberton School curriculum.
It covers essential backend concepts such as type annotations, asynchronous programming, pagination, caching, authentication, and more.

Each directory inside this repo corresponds to one standalone project with its own tasks and mandatory files.

📚 Content Overview

Here are some of the key topics covered across the repository (including this project and the others you will complete later):

🔡 Python Variable Annotations

Introduction to Python type hinting

Using the typing module (List, Tuple, Union, Callable, etc.)

Duck typing principles

Validating types with mypy

⚙️ Python Async (Advanced Tasks)

Async functions

async / await

Concurrency and parallelism

Measuring runtime performance

🔄 Pagination

How to paginate datasets efficiently

Server-side pagination

Hypermedia-style pagination

📦 Caching

Caching strategies using Redis

Storing, retrieving, and expiring cached data

Tracking web statistics

🔐 Authentication / Session Management

Basic authentication

Session IDs

User login flow

Storing credentials securely

(Depending on your progress, new directories will appear as new backend concepts are introduced.)
